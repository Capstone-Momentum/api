The census exposes all of their data through api queries using variables that can be found in json format
at this link... https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-1year.2018.html
Each year from 2011-2018 is exposed in this url and the json for the variables is exposed in the same
way on those pages.
The api offered by the census allows us to retrieve data specific to slo county and even at county/place
overlaps using the following 'predicates', as they call them, at the end of the queries...
- &for=county:079&in=state:06
- &for=county:*&in=state:01+place:62328

It seems viable for us to write a web scraper that goes through each of these pages (each year), store all
variables that exist for the given year in a table, then we can construct a query for every single existing variable
and add the county/place predicates to get the data for those variables specific to slo county and the districts
within it.
